# Sort Words

Sorts your words in Atom, till segfault do us part.

### Commands and Keybindings

All of the following commands are under the `atom-text-editor` selector.

If active buffer has selections, the commands operate on each selected range.
Otherwise, the commands operate on the whole text in the active buffer.

|Command|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|`sort-words:sort-case-insensitive`|Sort words (case-insensitive)|
|`sort-words:sort-case-sensitive`|Sort words (case-sensitive)|

Custom keybindings can be added by referencing the above commands. Since this
is not a common package, it has no default keymap. To learn more, visit the
[Using Atom: Basic Customization](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/#customizing-keybindings)
or [Behind Atom: Keymaps In-Depth](http://flight-manual.atom.io/behind-atom/sections/keymaps-in-depth)
sections in the flight manual.
